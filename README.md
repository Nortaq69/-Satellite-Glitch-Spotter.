# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Glitch Spotter

**Advanced Anomaly Detection System for Satellite Imagery Analysis**

## üìã Mission Brief

The Satellite Glitch Spotter is a cutting-edge web-based tool designed to analyze satellite imagery and identify visual anomalies that may indicate artifacts, glitches, or unexplained structures. Using advanced image processing algorithms, it scans uploaded satellite images and rates detected anomalies on a custom **Suspicion Scale‚Ñ¢**.

## üéØ Core Features

### üì§ **Upload Interface**
- Drag-and-drop or file picker for satellite image upload
- Supports JPG, PNG, and WebP formats
- Real-time image preview and validation

### üß† **Image Analysis Engine**
The tool employs multiple detection algorithms:

#### **Edge Detection (Sobel Algorithm)**
- Identifies sharp, unnatural lines or artificial patterns
- Highlights geometric structures that don't match natural terrain
- Detects potential man-made objects or digital artifacts

#### **Color Deviation Mapping**
- Scans for pixel clusters that differ drastically from surrounding terrain
- Detects black rectangles, bright blobs, or sudden color shifts
- Identifies potential camouflage or editing attempts

#### **Pattern Detection**
- Recognizes repeating pixel blocks indicative of glitch tiles
- Detects digital artifacts and compression patterns
- Identifies potential image manipulation or tampering

#### **Compression Artifact Detection**
- Shows areas with JPEG compression blocks
- Indicates potential edited or tampered regions
- Helps identify image authenticity

#### **Contour Mapping**
- Finds unusual geometric shapes
- Detects patterns that don't match organic or geological formations
- Identifies potential structures or anomalies

### üîç **Suspicion Scale‚Ñ¢**
- **0-2**: Normal compression artifacts or minor glitches
- **3-4**: Unusual color patterns or minor anomalies
- **5-6**: Suspicious geometric patterns or color deviations
